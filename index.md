Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

My name is Vipul Ramtekkar, and I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing Chemical Engineering, along with a minor in Computer Science & Engineering, at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).

To get an insight into my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf) and [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects).

I have also written [blogs]({{site.url}}/archive) about my summer research experiences. Feel free to read a bit more [about me]({{ site.url }}/about).
