Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

My name is Vipul Ramtekkar, and I am currently working as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Honda R&D Japan](https://www.honda.co.jp/RandD/). I received my undergraduate degree from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).

To get an insight into my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [curriculum vitae]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf) and [projects]({{ site.url }}/projects).

I have also written [blogs]({{site.url}}/archive) about my excellent summer research experiences at [University of Missouri Columbia](missouri.edu
) (Summer 2019) and [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) (Summer 2018). Feel free to read a bit more [about me]({{ site.url }}/about).
