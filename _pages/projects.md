#### **SeDriCa | UMIC**

The [Mahindra Rise Challenge](http://www.sparktherise.com/) envisages developing a working unit of a ‘driverless car’ for Indian conditions. Applicants will be required to develop and demonstrate such a car first for ‘controlled environments’ such as campuses, followed by an intra-city situation. Applicants can assume that the vehicle will drive on paved roads. 
Innovation Cell has received a Mahindra E2o Car for being in the **top 11** amongst 289 teams. 

_Machine Learning Engineer (Nov. '18 - Present)_

My work currently is to implement various machine learning architectures for the lane detection. I have implemented d-linknet architecture through which we have achieved satisfactory results. 


#### **AUV IIT Bombay**

AUV-IITB comprises of highly enthusiastic and hardworking technocrats ranging from bright-eyed first-year students to driven senior undergraduates and tech-experienced post-graduates spanning various branches of engineering like Mechanical, Electrical, Software, Aerospace, Material Science and Civil at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. The team works towards participating at [AUVSI Robosub Competition](https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub), which is held annually in July at San Diego, California. The competition is a platform for students to display their skills in underwater robotics and build a connection with industries working along similar verticals. The competition demands designing and manufacturing of an autonomous underwater vehicle that can perform predefined tasks. This draws upon expertise of the areas of engineering provided by multifaceted team. Currently, we are a 22 membered team developing cutting edge technology for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). The development of an AUV is a year long process involving design, manufacturing, assembly, testing, integration and competition preparation. To accelerate the development of MATSYA our team is structured into three subdivisions viz Mechanical, Electrical and Software. Every year the team puts in 30,000 man hours for the development and integration of our AUV MATSYA. 

_Chief Engineer(Aug. '16 - Jan. '18 )_

I was involved in the analysing the structures, rigorous testing and prototyping the parts of the vehicle. I have represented the team in various tech expositions. I was involved in the development of state of the art 2-D arm which could perform multiple actions. I improvised the designs of the torpedos for better range and designed a testing mechanism for the same.
