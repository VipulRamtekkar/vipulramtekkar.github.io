My name is Vipul Ramtekkar, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in Chemical Engineering Department. I am a technology enthusiast and love to tinker. I have done multiple projects related to automation and robotics, and currently, I am a member of [Sedrica](http://www.umiciitb.com/rise.html) working on lane detection. We are building a vehicle that suits the Indian road conditions and thus are doing rigorous research considering the circumstances of roads, markings, traffic and other problems related to the Indian transportations.

I have also taken part in the in the [InterIIT Tech Meet](http://inter-iit.tech/) for the year 2017 & 2018 and this year we built an autonomous strawberry harvester and achieved 3rd position for pitching the business model, demonstration of the prototype and the presenting the [technical paper]({{site.url}}/assets/report.pdf).

In my summer 2018, I was selected as a [UTSIP](https://www.ilo.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/summer_en) Scholar among 30 other students across the world. I was a part of [Morishita lab](https://www.morishita-lab.com/). I did my research on the classification of [transposons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element) by applying various machine learning techniques suitable for the extensive dataset and delve into visualisations to understand the data deeper. 

I was also a part of team [AUV IITB](http://www.auv-iitb.org/) in which we built an autonomous underwater vehicle, Matsya 5 to participate at [AUVSI Robosub](https://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub). You can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njcUPe0PbCE&t=242) explain about the different parts and working of the AUV. 

I am an avid reader and like both fiction and non-fiction. Currently, I am reading, [The Kite Runner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77203.The_Kite_Runner) by Khaled Hosseini. I would highly recommend reading [Kane and Abel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78983.Kane_and_Abel) by Jeffrey Archer and [The Alchemist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/865.The_Alchemist) by Paulo Coelho. I also enjoy watching movies especially thrillers and my personal favourite is [Shutter Island](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130884/). I also like solving puzzles and I am always up for discussions and debates on topics ranging from politics to science.
