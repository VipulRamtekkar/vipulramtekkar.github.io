USA, a country that I wanted to visit since I was kid. At that time the reasons were a lot different rather more out of curiosity seeing the country shown quite different in hollywood then something that I was accustomed to. But in the recent times after learning about the tremendous growth in technology in US and knowing about the amazing research hubs that it houses made me want to visit it even more. Also, I wanted to explore research furthur, and thus, was on a lookout for research opportunities. Got a positive response and before I could blink I was standing in the line of my expedited visa appointment. My visa experience was very smooth and extremely fast. I applied for biometrics on 30th May, gave my visa interview on 31st May, got my visa on 4th June, boarded my flight on 6th, and landed on 7th Midnight - A week in all. 

I travelled to Columbia from St. Louis on 8th morning. After purchasing a few essentials and getting my accomodation worked out, I was ready to begin. I tried to broaded my scope of work through the opportunity. I worked on tracking, object detection and multi-object tracking. The main theme of my project involved improving single object tracking for surveillance. Though there are many algorithms available but non were as robust and accurate as per the requirement of the project. The dataset was tough as it included all the possible cases where an algorithm could fail and increased the complexity of the task. Some of the problems that were to be tackled were 
1. Sudden drift of the object
2. Partial to full occulusion of the object 
3. Low object to image pixel ratio 
Thus, to tackle these problems we took a hollistic approach, and used fusion of algorithms to create a robust algorithm. If I were to highlight the main take aways apart from learning about the field at a deeper level would be learning about the various aspects of research. Though research in general is a slow process but I was lucky to be working on a project which was on a tight schedule, thus, each day was adding a delta result to the end goal. My lab hours were very flexible and Columbia being a college town is a safe place compared to other places in the US which allowed me to work late. 

Columbia is a college town and unlike the big cities in USA, its a calm place. The town is filled with a lot of food places in downtown and all in all I loved the atmosphere of a college town. The town has multiple huge parks and I got a chance to do caving, something which I had never done before. Caving is a activity which as the name suggest involves exploring caves. The natural caves were quite cold and one could feel the sudden drop of temperature on entering the cave. I loved how the independence day is celebrated in US
